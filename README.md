# Interactive DNS Manager for Debian/Ubuntu

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üìù Description

This is an interactive Bash script designed to simplify the management and application of DNS server configurations (IPv4 and IPv6) on Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux systems (such as Debian 11). It utilizes `NetworkManager` (via `nmcli`) to apply changes and `systemd-resolved` (via `resolvectl`) to display the current DNS status on the system.

The script allows you to maintain a list of favorite DNS servers, add new ones, edit, delete, and easily apply them to a specific network interface, ensuring that changes are effective by restarting the connection.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **DNS Server Management**:
    *   Display a list of saved IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers from a `dns_servers.lst` file.
    *   Add new DNS server entries (with name, IPv4, and IPv6).
    *   Edit existing entries (name, IPv4, IPv6).
    *   Delete entries.
*   **Applying DNS to Network Interfaces**:
    *   Select a saved DNS server to apply.
    *   List active network connection profiles managed by `NetworkManager`.
    *   Apply the selected DNS servers to a specific connection profile using `nmcli`.
    *   **Connection Restart**: Disables the network interface at the beginning of the application process to ensure the removal of previous DNS entries and re-enables it at the end to make the changes effective.
    *   Post-application verification to confirm the new DNS settings on the connection and via `resolvectl`.
*   **Listing Current System DNS**:
    *   Display the DNS servers currently in use by the system, detailed by interface (via `resolvectl status`).
    *   Show DNS configurations per `NetworkManager` connection profile (via `nmcli`).
*   **User-Friendly Interface**:
    *   Interactive and colored menu for easy navigation.
    *   Automatic screen clearing upon returning to the main menu.
    *   Basic IP address validation.
    *   Error handling and troubleshooting tips.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

This script has been developed and tested on **Debian 11**. It requires the following packages and tools:

*   **`sudo`**: To execute commands with superuser privileges.
*   **`network-manager`**: Main NetworkManager package.
*   **`nmcli`**: NetworkManager Command Line Interface tool (usually included with `network-manager`).
*   **`systemd-resolved`**: The default systemd DNS resolver (usually included).
*   **`resolvectl`**: Command-line tool to interact with `systemd-resolved` (usually included with `systemd-resolved`).
*   **Standard Bash tools**: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `touch`, `systemctl`, `clear` (or `printf`).

You can install the essential packages on Debian/Ubuntu with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install network-manager systemd-resolved
```
(`network-manager-gnome` and `network-manager-config-connectivity-debian` are GNOME/desktop components that typically install `network-manager` as a dependency, but for the script's functionality, the base `network-manager` is most important.)

## üì¶ How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Save the Script):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository # Or to the directory where you saved the script
    ```
    Alternatively, copy the script content and save it to a file, e.g., `manage_dns.sh`.

2.  **Grant Execute Permissions:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x manage_dns.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    ./manage_dns.sh
    ```

    The script will start the interactive menu:

    ```
    ========== DNS Management Menu ==========
    1. Display Registered DNS Servers
    2. Add New DNS Server
    3. Edit Existing DNS Server
    4. Delete DNS Server
    5. Apply DNS Server (Change on System via NetworkManager)
    6. List Current System DNS Servers
    7. Exit
    ==================================================
    Choose an option:
    ```

    Follow the on-screen instructions to manage your DNS servers. For options that modify the system (like option 5), you will be prompted to provide your `sudo` password.

## üìÇ File Structure

*   `manage_dns.sh`: The main Bash script.
*   `dns_servers.lst`: A text file that stores the DNS servers you add. It is created automatically if it doesn't exist. Each line in the file represents a DNS server, with fields separated by semicolons (`;`): `Name;IPv4_Addresses;IPv6_Addresses`.

    Example `dns_servers.lst`:
    ```
    Google DNS;8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4;2001:4860::8888,2001:4860::8844
    Cloudflare DNS;1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1;2606:4700::1111,2606:4700::1001
    My Local DNS;;fd00::1
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **`Error: 'sudo' not found.`**: Ensure the `sudo` package is installed (`sudo apt install sudo`) and your user is configured to use it.
*   **`Error: 'nmcli' not found.`**: Install the `network-manager` package: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install network-manager`.
*   **`Error: 'resolvectl' not found.`**: Install the `systemd-resolved` package: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install systemd-resolved`.
*   **`Warning: 'NetworkManager' service is not active.`**: Activate and enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager`.
*   **`Failed to apply DNS!` or connectivity issues after applying**:
    *   Check the script's error output for detailed messages.
    *   Confirm that the selected connection profile is correct and active (`nmcli con show --active`).
    *   Check the status of the NetworkManager service: `systemctl status NetworkManager`.
    *   There might be another network manager (like `ifupdown` or `dhcpcd`) interfering. On Debian 11, `NetworkManager` is the default for most desktop installations.
    *   Your SSH session might be interrupted when restarting the interface. If this happens, you may need to access the physical console or a new SSH session after the interface recovers.
*   **IPv6 IP Validation**: The IPv6 validation in the script is basic and does not cover all valid IPv6 notation forms. If you experience issues with an IPv6 that appears valid but is rejected, try a more canonical (full) form of the address.
